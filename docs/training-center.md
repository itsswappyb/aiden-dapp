- Real-time training progress monitoring
- Interactive start/stop controls
- Visual status indicators
- Training configuration display

### Training Visualization
- Real-time accuracy metrics
- Loss function tracking
- Interactive performance charts
- Training progress indicators
- Epoch completion tracking

### Agent Selection
- Grid view of available agents
- Status-based filtering
- Platform-specific grouping
- Quick-access training controls
- Visual status indicators

## Usage

### Starting Training
1. Navigate to the Training Center
2. Select an agent from the grid
3. Review training configuration
4. Click "Start Training" button
5. Monitor progress in real-time

### Monitoring Progress
1. View real-time metrics
2. Track accuracy and loss
3. Monitor epoch progress
4. Check validation metrics
5. Review training speed

### Managing Training
1. Start/stop training as needed
2. Review performance metrics
3. Adjust training parameters
4. Monitor resource usage
5. Save training checkpoints

## Training Metrics

### Accuracy Metrics
